# 📘 JavaScript Coding Repository

Welcome to my **JavaScript Coding Repo** – a curated collection of JavaScript practice exercises, mini-projects, algorithm challenges, and utilities. This repository serves as a personal learning archive, a resource for others learning JavaScript, and a foundation for future full-stack development.

## 📌 Motivation

JavaScript is one of the most powerful and versatile languages for web development. Whether you're working on frontend interactivity or backend logic using Node.js, mastering JavaScript is a must.

This repo was built with the goal of:

- Practicing core JavaScript concepts in a structured way
- Building reusable code snippets and utilities
- Experimenting with the DOM and asynchronous JS
- Preparing for technical interviews and coding rounds
